  - Cell filtering pipelines with overlap and intensity filters
  - Batch processing support using master sample list
  - Custom channel naming for tissue-specific markers
  
- **New Dependencies**
  - Added scikit-learn for machine learning features
  - Added matplotlib for visualization capabilities
  
- **Example Scripts**
  - `complete_workflow_example.py` - Full pipeline demonstration
  - `immune_cell_processing_example.py` - Tissue analysis workflows
  - Updated to use new CLI commands and APIs
